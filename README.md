     <br>
     1.) **Creational Patterns**
     
           * Patterns which provides a way to create object while hiding the creational logic rather than
             instantiating objects directly using the new operator.
                                                    
     2.) **Structural Patterns**
     
          * Patterns which concerns about class structure inheritance.
                                                    
     3.) **Behavioural Patterns**
     
          * Patterns which concerns about communication between objects.
